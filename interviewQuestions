OOPS Concepts
  Encapsulation
  - It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. 
    Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and restricting access to certain parts of the object. 
    This allows for better control over the data and prevents unintended external interference, leading to more secure and maintainable code.
  Inheritance
  - allows a new class (derived class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or superclass). 
    This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes
  Abstraction
  - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
    It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction allows developers to create simplified models that represent real-world objects more effectively.
    Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in programming languages like Java and C#.
  Polymorphism
  - Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context in which they are used.
    There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).

Valuetype ReferenceType
Key differences between value types and reference types:
- Value types are stored directly in memory, while reference types store references to memory locations.
- Assigning a value type variable creates a copy of the data, while assigning a reference type variable creates a reference to the same data.
- Changes to a value type variable do not affect other variables, while changes to a reference type variable affect all variables pointing to the same object.

Boxing Unboxing
1. Boxing:
- Boxing is the process of converting a value type (such as an integer, float, or struct) to an object reference type (System.Object) or an interface type.
- When a value type is boxed, a new object is created on the heap to store the value, and a reference to that object is returned.
- Boxing allows value types to be treated as objects and stored in collections that require reference types, such as ArrayList or List.
Example of boxing in C#:
  int number = 42;  object boxedNumber = number; // Boxing the integer value to an object reference
2. Unboxing:
- Unboxing is the process of converting an object reference type back to a value type.
- When unboxing, the runtime checks if the object is compatible with the target value type and then extracts the value from the object.
- If the object is not compatible with the target value type, an InvalidCastException is thrown at runtime.
Example of unboxing in C#:
  object boxedNumber = 42;<br>int number = (int)boxedNumber; // Unboxing the object reference to an integer value

Question:

```csharp
class A
{
 public void Method1()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class A Method 1");
 }

 public virtual void Method2()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class A Method 2");
 }
}

class B : A
{
 public new void Method1()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class B Method 1");
 }

 public override void Method2()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class B Method 2");
 }
}

class C : B
{
 public new void Method1()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class C Method 1");
 }

 public override void Method2()
 {
  Console.WriteLine("Class C Method 2");
 }
}

A a1 = new A();
a1.Method1();
a1.Method2();

A a2 = new B();
a2.Method1();
a2.Method2();

A a3 = new C();
a3.Method1();
a3.Method2();

B b1 = new B();
b1.Method1();
b1.Method2();

B b2 = new C();
b2.Method1();
b2.Method2();

C c1 = new C();
c1.Method1();
c1.Method2();
```

```
Class A Method 1

Class A Method 1
Class B Method 2

Class A Method 1

Class B Method 1
Class B Method 2

Class B Method 1

## RESTful services

Can you tell the disadvantages of RESTful web services?
The disadvantages are:

 As the services follow the idea of statelessness, it is not possible to maintain sessions. (Session simulation responsibility lies on the client-side to pass the session id)
 REST does not impose security restrictions inherently. It inherits the security measures of the protocols implementing it. Hence, care must be chosen to implement security measures like integrating SSL/TLS based authentications, etc

Differentiate between SOAP and REST

|SOAP |REST|
|---|---|
|SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol|REST - Representational State Transfer|
|SOAP is a protocol used to implement web services.|REST is an architectural design pattern for developing web services|
|SOAP cannot use REST as it is a protocol.|REST architecture can have SOAP protocol as part of the implementation.|
|SOAP specifies standards that are meant to be followed strictly.|REST defines standards but they need not be strictly followed.|
|SOAP client is more tightly coupled to the server which is similar to desktop applications having strict contracts.|The REST client is more flexible like a browser and does not depend on how the server is developed unless it follows the protocols required for establishing communication.|
|SOAP supports only XML transmission between the client and the server.|REST supports data of multiple formats like XML, JSON, MIME, Text, etc.|
|SOAP reads are not cacheable.|REST read requests can be cached.|
|SOAP uses service interfaces for exposing the resource logic.|REST uses URI to expose the resource logic.|
|SOAP is slower.|REST is faster.|
|Since SOAP is a protocol, it defines its own security measures.|REST only inherits the security measures based on what protocol it uses for the implementation.|
|SOAP is not commonly preferred, but they are used in cases which require stateful data transfer and more reliability.|REST is commonly preferred by developers these days as it provides more scalability and maintainability.|
